We design a fairness dataset that can detect the fairness of a model based on educational assessment. In addition, we propose the IRT model optimization based on ranking and add a new loss function, which can greatly improve the fairness of the student ability parameter theta obtained by IRT.


At present, the data set has been designed and the IRT model optimized - 2024.11.9
